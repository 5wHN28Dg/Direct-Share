# Direct-Share
An Android/Linux app to share files quickly and conveniently using Wi-Fi Direct

this project is still in research / experimentation / concept exploration, as I am still:
- exploring how things work.
- testing concepts.
- writing isolated code snippets.
- and don’t yet have a working prototype or even an initial internal build.

Features:
- as simple as it can get: right click on a file then select "share via Direct-Share"* or open the app, select a file, select the device you want to share with, click share then wait for the other device to accept the connection, and then enjoy your shared file!
- as fast as it can get: no hotspot, no local network, no internet connection required, aka no middleman, just the old and the good and unfortunately forgotten Wi-Fi Direct.
